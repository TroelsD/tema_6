            The title OK Computer is taken from the 1978 Hitchhiker's Guide to
            the Galaxy radio series, in which the character Zaphod Beeblebrox
            speaks the phrase "Okay, computer, I want full manual control now."
            The members of Radiohead listened to the series on the bus during
            their 1996 tour and Yorke made a note of the phrase.

            In 1995, Radiohead toured in support of their second album, The
            Bends (1995). Midway through the tour, Brian Eno commissioned them
            to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation
            organised by War Child; the album was to be recorded over the course
            of a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week.[6]
            Radiohead recorded "Lucky" in five hours with engineer Nigel
            Godrich, who had engineered on The Bends and produced several
            Radiohead B-sides.

            Radiohead found touring stressful and took a break in January 1996.
            They sought to distance their new material from the introspective
            style of The Bends. Yorke said he did not want to do "another
            miserable, morbid and negative record", and was "writing down all
            the positive things that I hear or see. I'm not able to put them
            into music yet and I don't want to just force it."
